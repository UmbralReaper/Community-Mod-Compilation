As a result, I'm now able to start thinking about the more serious probolems. You know why the password was 'Mycus must burn'? Because it's a far more dangerous opponent than any other monster. Well... Maybe not that dangerous, even the common pre-apocalypse antifungal substances kill it easily, not to mention its flammability, but the problem is that it grows. Zombies? They don't multpily, so there's already a finite number of them. Mutants, such as ants? They breed, but not that fast. However Mycus grows, and it must be stopped as soon as possible. Currently those two scientists you see here are working on the ways to combat it at a global scale, however with their computers they can only do so much. They claim they'd need to analyze the Mycus samples to progress further. And so I order you to go to the Mycus-occupied area and forage for twenty Marloss berries and bring them here for analysis. Also, obviously, bring some napalm with you and burn the whole place down to the ground, so that only ashes remain. Later burn down the ashes. And burn the whole area once more, better safe than sorry. Well, why am I explaining it to you? Maybe you're not from my squad, but you know the anti-Mycus procedures yourself, after all.",

The scientists are thankful for having the opportunity to try some experiments on that shit you've brought. But even they seem to be disturbed by the psionic attacks so much that while one is researching, the second is standing with a gun next to him just to make sure no one will eat any Marloss... Anywyas, the analysis of the active substances in the Fruit shows that it indeed contains some hallucinogens... And it should be fairly easy to get addicted to it. What is more interesing and odd, though, is that it also could possibly have some substances responsible for rebuilding tissues, regenerating blood cells and suppressing the pain... Also the scientists' first theory was that the 'psionic' attacks are nothing more than the hallicungoenic, but armoatic gases released by the Fruit, but it turned out to be false. There's nothing in this aroma expects substances that make it smell pleasantly and tempting... So, we don't know how those disruptive thoughts are generated. Another thing that can't get out of my head is that since the Mycus tries to make us 'join it' and it's obviously related to the Fruit, it indicates those berries can't be simply an addicting drug. It has to be something more. One of our researches suggested, that the Fruit alone is not enough for him and he'd like to observe the full life cycle of the Mycus products... And so here I am, sending you to the field to find yet another Mycus bloom and forage through it before burning it down.",

It was tall and looked solid, growing as high as a... tower? Yeah, tower is the best word I can think of right now... Damn, those mutants surely got comfy in our world! The merchants have also told me about some rumours of some survivors seen approaching the Tower alone, naked and with insanity in their eyes... They're supposed to be the ones 'joining' the Mycus... If that's true, then the Tower should also hold the ultimate answers to our questions related to learning about our foe. The merchants have revealed to me the location of that tower they've seen.

To keep things short and simple, our researchers suggest that in order to join the Mycus one has to eat all three things - the Fruit, Seeds and the samples you've brought from the Tower. Although the 'preferred' way is to approach the Tower after eating the berries and seeds and letting it inject you with that fungal venom... As for the psionics, we've only discovered that the Mycus has a hive mind, so the thoughts generated by its fruits are in fact the thoughts of the whole Mycus... We still don't fully understand this, but various tests has confirmed that such psionic capability seems to be 'hardcoded' in their biology, so no special devices required. Which means that whoever joins those bastards loses his/her 'private' personality and gets linked to the hive mind. And here comes the sketch of an idea - if we could somehow link to their mind, but without 'joining', so without losing ourselves (and having our bodies infested with fungus), we could possibly interact with the Mycus on the psionic level and wreak some chavoc in their territory... Our fellow two scientists are eager to get to work on altering the 'ingredients' you've brought here so that consuming them would open up the possibility to 'talk' with the Mycus yet won't end with the person being corrupted or having the body contaminated with spores or something like that. However, they'd need so-called 'mutagen'. They claim that before the lab 'incident' they were working on some substances capable of altering humans in some insane ways... They hope that same substances can be used to alter the Mycus fruits as well...",
