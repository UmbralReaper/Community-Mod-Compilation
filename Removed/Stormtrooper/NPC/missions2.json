Normally you'd have to pass your military training with distinction to even get a chance to start your spec-ops training... But the normality is gone. However, you still have to prove yourself somehow. My first assignment for you is to go out there and kill 250 mutants. But not regular zombies. That's too easy. I mean true mutants. All those giant ants, spiders, that kind of horrors the apocalypse has spawned. If you survive, go back here and report to me about your combat.",
