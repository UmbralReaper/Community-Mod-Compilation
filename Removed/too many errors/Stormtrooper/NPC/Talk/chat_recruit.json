Wear it all the time exactly as you do with your Marshal badge - with it other Stormtrooper will recognize you. Regarding your duties, we're now (as you probably already know) purging the world of all evil. The operation is called 'The Dawn of the Purge', password 'Mycus must burn'. You're now a part of this operation. Your squad is XC-175, that's the ID of the squad exterminated in the military base you've already been to. And before you ask anything: no, you're not left alone. In practice you're going to be a member of our squad here, XC-177, and the assignment to XC-175 is only important as a symbol, because no squad has been wiped out completely before, so to keep this tradition someone has to 'repopulate' XC-175. Remember this, because other Stormtroopers may demand identification from you, just to make sure that badge is really yours. Now go talk with the commander, he'll have orders for you. Also stay here and rest if you need to.",
