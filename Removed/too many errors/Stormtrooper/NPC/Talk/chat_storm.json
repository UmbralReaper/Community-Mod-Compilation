They've fortified themselves in one of the refugee centers and seem to share with us the goal of rebuilding civilization, but sadly they don't accept any new members due to food problems. However, cooperation with them might still be profitable for you and they'll let you stay in their guest area. Also stay sharp while approaching military facilities. I understand the world has ended and won't mind you taking a few guns from them, but some of the bases have been overrun by unknown powerful soldiers. I know this, because at the beginning of an end we've lost an entire suqad in one of the military bases. Their last radio messages were describing some heavily armed soldiers... And one more thing. If I recall correctly, one of the towns out there had had a massive underground vault built in case of a national emergency. If these rumours are correct, I bet that vault will be occupied by a community of survivors, probably the whole large society. It might be the best place for you if you can reach it. Oh, last but not least, beware the Mycus. Even if you have the means of protecting your body from fungal infection, those bastards are still dangerous. They seem to be psionic capable and if you stay in their neighbourhood they'll constantly disrupt your mind by trying to convince you to join them. And if you decide to help us by burning them (which is greatly appreciated!) DON'T PICK ANY OF THEIR FRUITS! JUST BURN EVERYTHING DOWN! After eating those fruits you're most probably a lost cause. I'd really hate to have to burn you down.",
