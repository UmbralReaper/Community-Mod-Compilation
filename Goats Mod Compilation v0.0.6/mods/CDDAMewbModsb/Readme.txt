The first mod adds more monster variety to labs to make them much more challenging and more like endgame areas. You can manipulate the density rates with a text editor if you donâ€™t think there are enough monster spawns. I tried to keep it kinda balanced for lab-escape starts.

The second mod adds makeshift fungicide by combining bleach and ammonia with jugs or empty cans (which kills like 90% of fungus irl).

If you have any feedback or comments, suggestions etc please comment in the thread.
