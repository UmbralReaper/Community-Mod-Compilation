This is an initial test candidate version for the re-worked blazemod. 

Please make sure to delete the repo version of blazemod from the \data\mods folder or it will cause issues.
If you're using the CDDA Launcher by RemRoy, you can instead put this new blazemod folder in \CDDA Game Launcher\cdda\mods instead of the usual
\CDDA Game Launcher\cdda\data\mods\ and it will stop being replaced every time you update, but you'll still need to delete the repo's version of it each
time you update.

If you have any issues or encounter any bugs related to the use of this mod, please let me know @SouP#7927 in either CDDA discord, or comment on the Github
page at https://github.com/CleverRaven/Cataclysm-DDA/pull/37497

Thanks for testing, I hope you have fun!
