## new car parts added in legacy and new tileset
## in the future there will be more situations like this - car changes, it now consist untiled parts so it will not have graphics for it. Depending on number of new car parts added it will take some time to draw them, so wait for it for some time before reporting

Tileset for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead based on the works by Xotto, Waldo and others. My goal is to make most complete tileset for the game, with support for all mods what are out there.


## Prerequisites

This tileset always updating to content from latest experimental version of the game.
Latest game version can be downloaded here https://cataclysmdda.org/experimental/

## Installing

Download this tileset, put folder MSX++UnDeadPeopleEdition or MSX++UnDeadPeopleEditionLegacy in "CDDA Installation folder"/gfx, in the game choose *UNDEAD_PEOPLE (NEW VERSION)* or *UNDEAD_PEOPLE_LEGACY* tileset in **Settings->Options->Graphics->Choose Tileset**

*UNDEAD_PEOPLE (NEW VERSION)* - latest updated version of the tileset. On it's own it only covers main game and do not supports any mods (which comes with the game or located in other places). To get graphics for mods you will need to enable mods with the same name as mod what are you going to use plus "- UndeadPeople Tileset" in it's name under "graphical" category.

So for mod like *"PKs Rebalancing"* you will need to enable *"PKs Rebalancing - UndeadPeople Tileset"* along side with it to get graphics for this mod.

*UNDEAD_PEOPLE_LEGACY* - old version of the tileset. It does supports mods out of the box like before, but is no longer updated due problems with performance.

## How to install Mods (the proper way)
Put *Mods* folder in "CDDA Installation folder", **NOT**  in "CDDA Installation folder"/data, that way you can separate mods what are updated with the game and mods you downloaded somewhere else, what you need to update by hand.

Mods what bundled with this tileset (other then mods with graphics for other mods) are graphical mods designed to work with this tileset and change certain aspects of it.

If graphical mod (or any other mod with supplemental tileset inside (Secronom, Arcana, etc.)) do not work - save the game, close it, open it again and load save. It should 100% hook mods with tileset to the game.

## Interesting Mods with Undead_People sub tilesets (mini tileset within mod folder)

This tileset was provided with generous resourses from upcoming game Nearly Dead made by Xotto and Toro. In the future it will use many item graphics from this game in this tileset which was provided to me by Xotto with no gain to him or his game except for the mention of artists. Despite that i am gonna support and promote this game on this github for everybody to see. Please consider supporting it in the future, it looks like awesome Cataclysm inspired real time survival game and it is made by Cataclysm modders.
