 As you may know, my tileset is higly unorganized, ram munching mess. While you playing the game it loads a lot of stuff from various mods what you never gonna use. You can't easily change or add tiles in my tileset cause each time you do you have to edit giant tilesheet. All of this will end very soon. My tileset migration to another format is in effect.
It is a relativy long process, but it soon will be finished.
# For now know this: 
## Tileset called MSX++UndeadPeople is NOW only for dda module, and only need to be used if you not using any other mod becides dda. If you playing with other mods do not use it, cause any stuff from the mods will not have graphics. Use  UndeadPeopleLegacy tileset for now if you playing with other mods.

I am now starting slowly to add mods with graphics. To use graphics for mods with new UndeadPeople select mod called "*name_of_the_mod* - UndeadPeople Tileset" in mod selection screen (or add ID of the mod with the graphics at the bottom of mods.json).

Soon i will update this record with new information and even maybe even wright something more coherent!

# MSX++UndeadPeople Tileset

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/BFQzWtC.png)

Tileset for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead based on the works by Xotto, Waldo and others. My goal is to make most complete tileset for the game, with support for all mods what are out there.


## Prerequisites

This tileset always updating to content from latest experimental version of the game.
Latest game version can be downloaded here https://cataclysmdda.org/experimental/

## Installing

Download this tileset, put folder MSX++UnDeadPeopleEdition in "CDDA Installation folder"/gfx, in the game choose *UNDEAD_PEOPLE* tileset in **Settings->Options->Graphics->Choose Tileset**

If you using only DDA module (and maybe some little mods what do not add any stuff) use tileset named "UndeadPeople_DDA_only"

## How to install Mods (the proper way)
Put *Mods* folder in "CDDA Installation folder", **NOT**  in "CDDA Installation folder"/data, that way you can separate mods what are updated with the game and mods you downloaded somewhere else, what you need to update by hand.

Mods what bundled with this tileset are graphical mods designed to work with this tileset and change certain aspects of it.

If graphical mod (or any other mod with supplemental tileset inside (Secronom, Arcana, etc.)) do not work - save the game, close it, open it again and load save. It should 100% hook mods with tileset to the game.

# Nearly Dead

This tileset was provided with generous resourses from upcoming game Nearly Dead made by Xotto and Toro. In the future it will use many item graphics from this game in this tileset which was provided to me by Xotto with no gain to him or his game except for the mention of artists. Despite that i am gonna support and promote this game on this github for everybody to see. Please consider supporting it in the future, it looks like awesome Cataclysm inspired real time survival game and it is made by Cataclysm modders.
