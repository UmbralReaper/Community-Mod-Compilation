Indeed, recent information suggests that there may be a new rash of attacks by some unknown xenoforms.  I haven't had the opportunity to gather extensive data on this, but I did recently discuss something with my superiors regarding a recent patrol fending off creatures that don't fit the usual patterns.  I'll relay that information to your benefactors, I guess."
