# BL9
A huge content mod for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead greatly inspired by Resident Evil 4 by Capcom

## Prerequisites 
**None, but playing with BIG content mods (Magiclysm, Aftershock, Secronom, Cata++, Arcana, Fallout New England, PK rebalancing, Blazemod) is STRONGLY ADVISED because the content of this mod is QUITE MID-GAME to END-GAME so weapons, armor and balance changes from other mods will come in handy**

**IMPORTANT - PUT ONLY ONE OUT OF 3 VERSIONS DEPENDING ON YOUR CHOSEN MONSTER_RESILIENCE MODIFIER DURING WORLD GENERATION**

## What you'll experience and main features

**1) Adds over 175+ overmaps - huge crazed Ancient Castlelan Castle, Military heavily guarded Island, various custom unique structures-biomes infested by ALL kinds of monsters with GREAT rewards and bosses to fight**

**2) New guns (30 ranged weapons - 3 tiers of them with 2 tiers of sleek and unique craftable ammo - BALLISTICS TOO), unique craftable melee weapons (using all kinds of vanilla martial arts) and armor (2 tiers of well-made strong BL9-infused survivor armor)**

**3) Dangerous monsters and bosses to fight - from cultist and heavily armed military roaming patrols to heavily mutated creatures and tough bosses inspired greatly by Resident Evil by Capcom creatures**

**4) Carefully and well-made linear balance system - you'll be slowly going from mid-game structures and monsters to end-game truly DANGEROUS locations and bosses with lots of valuable stuff to collect and craft**

**5) Unique lore in the form of journals and notes - learn about secret organizations, origin of "BL9" organism and the evil plans of a vile faction that wants to establish the New World Order**

**6) Unique Merchant NPC system done by Axema - collect currency from BL9 monsters and buy Tier 1 and Tier 2 ranged weapons and armor - what are ya buying, stranger?**

**7) New well-made beautiful vivid and colorful terrain biome tiles support made by the great tileset maker SomeDeadGuy - truly vivid and nice looking biome terrains**

**8) Unique Herb Healing system done by me - You can instantly heal a certain part of your HP while in combat but be careful to not overdo it in combat - you get a stacking temporary debuff which gets only longer the more you use the herbs**

**9) Bright Nights and Pre-nested version support - NO errors, working perfectly fine - get it here https://mega.nz/file/7F1mEITY#6Fp8_LVOSa8Cid8P09TIZW9WJxrg2nZ7Et5T5F3Oln0**
