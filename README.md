# TheGoatGod's Mod Compilation
Welcome to TheGoatGod's Mod Compilation. Currently contains over 275 mods, 5 tile sets, 40 NO Mods, and several sound packs. It is currently, at 0.08, not entirely bug free, but it is undergoing constant improvements, and should soon be bug free. Many changes are planned for the future, consolidating mods to reduce the amount of excess, and cleaning up the code (even more!).

# Changelog
## 0.09a

- Color update
- Migration update
- alot of fixes

---
## 0.09

- Docs have been updated for greater clarity.
- Many, many, bugs have been fixed - including some added by us, oops!
- Folder update: files have been renamed and re-organised into their proper folders.
- Working on adding .GitHub files to make contributing easier.

---
## 0.08

- Currently going through a big volume and weight update; nearly done. A LOT of back-end work is being done to make the code cleaner and easier to work with. Several new mods have also been added.
- Expect a better change log in future, just know that there's a lot of work being put in to bring legacy code up to date.
- Expect more and less mods at the same time in 1.0 (I don't see the point in having multiple mods that add items or clothes).
- There's been tonnes for mod updates since E check their page out.
- This release doesn't work so well. 0.09 will work properly.
- Expect big changes to mods after 0.09, want to make them more realistic and this is my compilation (better for the community)

---
## 0.07

- Updated various different sections of code in the mods:
    pocket data updates
    bullet resist
    etc
- Moved tools and various different things to separate download for a smaller download size although it's still 1GB for all the sound.
- Updated 2ch and @s sound packs with another sound pack for more sound .
- @s sound pack plays the sound track that is there as well.
- and more check out the commits I'm not looking over them again unless I have to.
