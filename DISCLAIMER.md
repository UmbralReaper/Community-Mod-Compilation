Every mod is currently noted as being maintained by TheGoatGod unless it is actively (less than 3 months of inactivity) updated. 

All mods are being maintained regardless of whether TheGoatGod's name is there or not. (I will change this at some point)

I will update everymod, when I update a big mod I will add [GMC] once updated I will remove again, small mod expect to be [GMC]

Expect every mod to be working by the time 0.F is done.
