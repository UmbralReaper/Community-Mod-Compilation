![alt text](https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/1268900/header.jpg)

This tileset was provided with generous resourses from upcoming game Nearly Dead made by Xotto and Toro. In the future it will use many item graphics from this game in this tileset which was provided to me by Xotto with no gain to him or his game except for the mention of artists. Despite that i am gonna support and promote this game and it's kickstarter page on this github for everybody to see. Please consider supporting it, it looks like awesome Cataclysm inspired real time survival game and it is made by Cataclysm modders.

Tileset for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead based on the works by Xotto, Waldo and others. My goal is to make most complete tileset for the game, with support for all mods what are out there.


## Prerequisites

This tileset always updating to content from latest experimental version of the game.
Latest game version can be downloaded here https://cataclysmdda.org/experimental/

## Installing

Download this tileset, put folder MSX++UnDeadPeopleEdition in "CDDA Installation folder"/gfx, in the game choose *UNDEAD_PEOPLE* tileset in **Settings->Options->Graphics->Choose Tileset**

## How to install Mods (the proper way)
Put *Mods* folder in "CDDA Installation folder", **NOT**  in "CDDA Installation folder"/data, that way you can separate mods what are updated with the game and mods you downloaded somewhere else, what you need to update by hand.

Mods what bundled with this tileset are graphical mods designed to work with this tileset and change certain aspects of it.

If graphical mod (or any other mod with supplemental tileset inside (Secronom, Arcana, etc.)) do not work - save the game, close it, open it again and load save. It should 100% hook mods with tileset to the game.
