# MSX++UndeadPeople Tileset

Tileset for Cataclysm Dark Days Ahead based on the works by Xotto, Waldo and others. My goal is to make most complete tileset for the game, with support for all mods what are out there.

## Prerequisites

This tileset always updating to content from latest experimental version of the game.
Latest game version can be downloaded here https://cataclysmdda.org/experimental/

## Installing

Download this tileset, put folder MSX++UnDeadPeopleEdition in "CDDA Installation folder"/gfx, in the game choose *UNDEAD_PEOPLE* tileset in **Settings->Options->Graphics->Choose Tileset**

## How to install Mods (the proper way)
Put *Mods* folder in "CDDA Installation folder", **NOT**  in "CDDA Installation folder"/data, that way you can separate mods what are updated with the game and mods you downloaded somewhere else, what you need to update by hand.

Mods what bundled with this tileset are graphical mods designed to work with this tileset and change certain aspects of it.

If graphical mod (or any other mod with supplemental tileset inside (Secronom, Arcana, etc.)) do not work - save the game, close it, open it again and load save. It should 100% hook mods with tileset to the game.
