Installation:

Put all folder into CataclysmDDA/Data/Mods

b_bionics.json must be renamed bionics.json and replaced with the nomral file in CataclysmDDA/Data/Json

Be sure to put the base bionics_json file in a safe place first (suggest a new back folder in the games directory)
(I HAVE ALREADY ADDED A BACKUP WITH THIS FILE INCASE YOU LOSE YOURS)

If wanna play another character you just have to swap the bionics.json back with the original, or just leave it cause tbh a lot of the bionics were trash.
(Though it'd have magic descriptions)



YOU NEED TO HAVE THE B_BIONICS.JSON REMOVED FROM THE WARLOCK FOLDER, SO CUT AND PAST DON'T COPY AND PASTE SO KEEP THE ZIP/RAR FILE IN HERE TO KEEP TRACK
