Its contents are drawn with chaotic handwriting in disorderly, figures and mathematical expressions whose meanings are unknown, languages that have never been seen, and picturesque of monstrous monstrous names.

Then strange things nature and content came into my mind. Apparently this is like a recipe to build a follower called shoggoth.",
